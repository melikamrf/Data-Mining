# Data-Mining 
Each of the four projects in this course focused on a specific topic in data mining. Below is a brief description of each project.

### Final: Classification
Models such as SVM, MLP, CBA, and logistic regression were trained on the [Portuguese bank marketing dataset](Final/banking.csv) to classify deposit subscriptions. [AutoFeat](https://github.com/cod3licious/autofeat), a feature engineering library, is used to create non-linear features for the logistic regression model.

### CA3: Clustering
[This project](3/DM_CA3_810197581.ipynb) consists of two parts. In the first part, k-means was used to cluster [car insurance company data](3/car_insurance.csv), and in the second part, DBSCAN was used to cluster [earthquake data](3/earthquake_ir.csv) since 2010. The silhouette coefficient was used to measure clustering quality.

### CA2: Frequent Pattern Mining
[This project](2/DM_CA2_810197581.ipynb) utilized Apriori and FPGrowth to mine frequent itemsets and association rules to create personalized movie recommendations for users based on their viewing history.
